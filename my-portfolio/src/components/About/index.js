                    Hello! I am Hung, based in US with over 20 years of experience, 
                    from technical support & deployment, to product management/strategy, 
                    to presales and business development. Working with customers seems 
                    like a second nature to me. The one thing I'd say is put in the effort 
                    to understand your customers' needs and advocate for them; it will 
                    show and they will come to trust you.  
                    <hr/>
                    A soon-to-be full-stack developer (wannabe)! Life learning, 
                    a journey that never ends - even after-life, I think. :-)
